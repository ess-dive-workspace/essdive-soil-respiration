# ESS-DIVE Reporting Format for Soil Respiration v1.0.1

This documentation contains guidance for the content and format of ESS-DIVE soil respiration data and metadata reporting format. This reporting format has been developed to meet the needs of the researchers for a unified reporting format. This initial effort covers the most common variables and provides templates for metadata reporting.
